# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
This project focuses on detecting Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) from retinal fundus images using a combination of image preprocessing, feature extraction, and deep learning techniques. The pipeline enhances image quality, extracts clinically significant features (vessels, lesions, optic disc/cup), and applies machine learning models for classification.
